       "  1: \"Author: Prateek   \\n \\n  2 \\n \\nChess, the game of kings and queens, has captivated minds for centuries. From its \\nhumble beginnings in ancient India to its current status as a global phenomenon, \\nchess has evolved into a complex and fascinating pursuit. Let's embark on a journey \\nthrough time to explore the development of this royal game. \\nFrom Chaturanga to Chess: The Birth of a Legend \\nOur story begins in India, around 600 CE, with a game called chaturanga. This early ancestor of \\nchess represented the four divisions of the Indian military: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and \\nchariots. As trade routes expanded, so did the reach of this intriguing game. Chaturanga spread \\nto Persia, where it underwent its first transformation. The Persians modified the pieces and \\nrules, developing it into a game called Shatranj. From Persia, the game continued its journey, \\ncarried by traders and conquerors alike. \\nThe European Evolution: Pawns Get a Boost \\nBy the 10th century, chess had made its way to Europe through North Africa and the expanding \\nArabian empire. However, it wasn't until around 1200 CE that the game underwent dramatic \\nchanges, shaping it into the chess we know today. In Italy and Spain, innovative players \\nintroduced exciting new rules: \\n• Pawns gained the ability to move two squares on their first move \\n• Bishops became long-range pieces, dominating diagonals \\n• Queens transformed into the most powerful piece on the board \\nThese changes injected new life into the game, setting the stage for centuries of strategic \\nexploration. \\nCoffee House Chess: The Game Goes Public \\nDuring the 18th century, the chess world shifted its focus to Western Europe. Cities like London \\nand Paris became hubs of chess activity, with matches played in bustling coffee houses. This \\nperiod saw chess transition from a pastime of the nobility to a game enjoyed by a broader \\naudience. \",\n",
       "  2: 'Author: Prateek   \\n \\n  3 \\n \\nThe Birth of Competitive Chess \\nThe 19th century marked a turning point for chess as it evolved into a competitive sport: \\n• 1851: The first chess tournament was held in London, won by German player Adolf \\nAnderssen \\n• 1886: The first official World Chess Championship took place \\nAs chess gained popularity, the need for standardization grew. In 1924, the World Chess \\nFederation (FIDE) was founded in Paris, taking responsibility for organizing international \\ncompetitions and awarding titles. \\nChess in the Modern Era: From Grandmasters to \\nComputers \\nThe 20th century saw chess reach new heights of complexity and popularity: \\n• 1914: Czar Nicholas II of Russia immortalized the term \"Grandmaster\" \\n• 1950s-1980s: Soviet players dominated the chess world \\n• 1997: IBM\\'s Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov, marking a milestone \\nin computer chess \\nToday, chess continues to evolve. Online platforms have made the game more accessible than \\never, allowing players from around the world to compete and learn together. The royal game \\nthat began in India 1,500 years ago has truly conquered the world, with FIDE reporting 172 \\nmember countries. Whether you\\'re a beginner or a seasoned player, the rich history of chess \\nadds depth to every move you make on the board. So next time you sit down for a game, \\nremember you\\'re not just playing chess – you\\'re participating in a centuries-old tradition of \\nstrategy, skill, and intellectual combat. \\n '},\n",

This is an\\nexperimental feature and may not work for some cases. It only checks the extents of ticklabels, axis labels,\\nand titles.\\nSimple Example\\nIn matplotlib, the location of axes (including subplots) are speciﬁed in normalized ﬁgure coordinates. It can\\nhappen that your axis labels or titles (or sometimes even ticklabels) go outside the ﬁgure area, and are thus\\nclipped.\\nplt.rcParams[\\'savefig.facecolor\\'] = \"0.8\"\\ndef example_plot(ax, fontsize=12):\\nax.plot([1, 2])\\nax.locator_params(nbins=3)\\nax.set_xlabel(\\'x-label\\', fontsize=fontsize)\\nax.set_ylabel(\\'y-label\\', fontsize=fontsize)\\n40\\nChapter 3.
